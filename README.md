# Twitter_Bot
This is a basic Twitter bot that tweets daily at a specified time and keeps a daily 
counter that increments every time the tweet is sent.<br/>

This utilizes Tweepy, schedule, time, and  datetime to handle everything.<br/>
The credentials used to allow Tweepy to interact with Twitter need to be accessed from your
developer.twitter.com account.

You can find them by logging into the site then going to:  
Team dropdown> Apps> Details> Keys and Tokens<br/>

Tweepy documentation can be found [here](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/).  
Schedule documentation can be found [here](schedule.readthedocs.io).
